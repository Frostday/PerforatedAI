# Perforated AI
Perforated AI is the Dendritic Intelligence Company.  We have released this open source repo to drive support for research on dendrite networks.

This code provides the ability to add artificial dendrites to PyTorch neural networks.  The new nodes are trained with standard gradient descent, meaning they are simply neurons arranged in a dendritic 
architecture.  Much current research in this space, [like this example](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56297-9), shows the significant impact of leveraging modern neuroscience to improve 
modern AI with this method. However, other research either does not contain open source implementations, or only provides the exact architecture for the exact experiments in their project. The main 
differentiator for this open source implementation is that with under an hour of coding you can add dendrites to any existing PyTorch project and advance your own research by joining us on the cutting 
edge of ML theory.

Additional details can be found in our [implementation API](https://github.com/PerforatedAI/PerforatedAI-API) and [examples repository](https://github.com/RorryB/PAI-Working-Examples).  If you like 
this project please star the repo to support this tech getting into the official PyTorch ecosystem and join our [discord](https://discord.gg/Fgw3FG3Hzt) to stay in the loop on the newest updates in 
Dendritic AI.

## Alternative Training Mechanisms

If you would like to get additional performance boosts from dendritic architectures through Perforated Backpropagation<sup>TM</sup> please join our beta program at 
[perforatedai.com](www.perforatedai.com/premium-registration).  Details on this approach can be found in our [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18018).

## Impact of Dendrites

Following are results generated by our researchers and our hackathon participants adding dendrites with gradient descent (GD) or Perforated Backpropagation<sup>TM</sup> (PB).

### DSN BERT

[DSN BERT](https://github.com/PerforatedAI/PerforatedAI-Examples/tree/master/libraryExamples/huggingface/BERT) is reproducing the results of our [hackathon 
winners](https://www.perforatedai.com/natural-language-processing-3-25) experiments with DSN BERT on the IMDB Dataset.

### ResNet 

[ResNet](https://github.com/PerforatedAI/PerforatedAI-Examples/tree/master/otherExamples/resNet) is a new example running a ResNet 18 model on the EMNIST Dataset

### Basic CNN

The CNN example is running the default PyTorch mnist example, included here, on the MNIST dataset.
